# clue/reactphp-redis [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/clue/reactphp-redis.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/clue/reactphp-redis)

Async [Redis](https://redis.io/) client implementation, built on top of [ReactPHP](https://reactphp.org/).

[Redis](https://redis.io/) is an open source, advanced, in-memory key-value database.
It offers a set of simple, atomic operations in order to work with its primitive data types.
Its lightweight design and fast operation makes it an ideal candidate for modern application stacks.
This library provides you a simple API to work with your Redis database from within PHP.
It enables you to set and query its data or use its PubSub topics to react to incoming events.

* **Async execution of Commands** -
  Send any number of commands to Redis in parallel (automatic pipeline) and
  process their responses as soon as results come in.
  The Promise-based design provides a *sane* interface to working with async responses.
* **Event-driven core** -
  Register your event handler callbacks to react to incoming events, such as an incoming PubSub message event.
* **Lightweight, SOLID design** -
  Provides a thin abstraction that is [*just good enough*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_good_enough)
  and does not get in your way.
  Future or custom commands and events require no changes to be supported.
* **Good test coverage** -
  Comes with an automated tests suite and is regularly tested against versions as old as Redis v2.6 and newer.

## Quickstart example

Once [installed](#install), you can use the following code to connect to your
local Redis server and send some requests:

```php
$loop = React\EventLoop\Factory::create();
$factory = new Factory($loop);

$client = $factory->createLazyClient('localhost');
$client->set('greeting', 'Hello world');
$client->append('greeting', '!');

$client->get('greeting')->then(function ($greeting) {
    // Hello world!
    echo $greeting . PHP_EOL;
});

$client->incr('invocation')->then(function ($n) {
    echo 'This is invocation #' . $n . PHP_EOL;
});

// end connection once all pending requests have been resolved
$client->end();

$loop->run();
```

See also the [examples](examples).

## Usage

### Factory

The `Factory` is responsible for creating your [`Client`](#client) instance.
It also registers everything with the main [`EventLoop`](https://github.com/reactphp/event-loop#usage).

```php
$loop = \React\EventLoop\Factory::create();
$factory = new Factory($loop);
```

If you need custom DNS, proxy or TLS settings, you can explicitly pass a
custom instance of the [`ConnectorInterface`](https://github.com/reactphp/socket#connectorinterface):

```php
$connector = new \React\Socket\Connector($loop, array(
    'dns' => '127.0.0.1',
    'tcp' => array(
        'bindto' => '192.168.10.1:0'
    ),
    'tls' => array(
        'verify_peer' => false,
        'verify_peer_name' => false
    )
));

$factory = new Factory($loop, $connector);
```

#### createClient()

The `createClient(string $redisUri): PromiseInterface<Client,Exception>` method can be used to
create a new [`Client`](#client).

It helps with establishing a plain TCP/IP or secure TLS connection to Redis
and optionally authenticating (AUTH) and selecting the right database (SELECT).

```php
$factory->createClient('redis://localhost:6379')->then(
    function (Client $client) {
        // client connected (and authenticated)
    },
    function (Exception $e) {
        // an error occurred while trying to connect (or authenticate) client
    }
);
```

The method returns a [Promise](https://github.com/reactphp/promise) that
will resolve with a [`Client`](#client)
instance on success or will reject with an `Exception` if the URL is
invalid or the connection or authentication fails.

The returned Promise is implemented in such a way that it can be
cancelled when it is still pending. Cancelling a pending promise will
reject its value with an Exception and will cancel the underlying TCP/IP
connection attempt and/or Redis authentication.

```php
$promise = $factory->createClient($redisUri);

$loop->addTimer(3.0, function () use ($promise) {
    $promise->cancel();
});
```

The `$redisUri` can be given in the
[standard](https://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes/prov/redis) form
`[redis[s]://][:auth@]host[:port][/db]`.
You can omit the URI scheme and port if you're connecting to the default port 6379:

```php
// both are equivalent due to defaults being applied
$factory->createClient('localhost');
$factory->createClient('redis://localhost:6379');
```

Redis supports password-based authentication (`AUTH` command). Note that Redis'
authentication mechanism does not employ a username, so you can pass the
password `h@llo` URL-encoded (percent-encoded) as part of the URI like this:

```php
// all forms are equivalent
$factory->createClient('redis://:h%40llo@localhost');
$factory->createClient('redis://ignored:h%40llo@localhost');
$factory->createClient('redis://localhost?password=h%40llo');
```

You can optionally include a path that will be used to select (SELECT command) the right database:

```php
// both forms are equivalent
$factory->createClient('redis://localhost/2');
$factory->createClient('redis://localhost?db=2');
```

You can use the [standard](https://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes/prov/rediss)
`rediss://` URI scheme if you're using a secure TLS proxy in front of Redis:

```php
$factory->createClient('rediss://redis.example.com:6340');
```

You can use the `redis+unix://` URI scheme if your Redis instance is listening
on a Unix domain socket (UDS) path:

```php
$factory->createClient('redis+unix:///tmp/redis.sock');

// the URI MAY contain `password` and `db` query parameters as seen above
$factory->createClient('redis+unix:///tmp/redis.sock?password=secret&db=2');

// the URI MAY contain authentication details as userinfo as seen above
// should be used with care, also note that database can not be passed as path
$factory->createClient('redis+unix://:secret@/tmp/redis.sock');
```

This method respects PHP's `default_socket_timeout` setting (default 60s)
as a timeout for establishing the connection and waiting for successful
authentication. You can explicitly pass a custom timeout value in seconds
(or use a negative number to not apply a timeout) like this:

```php
$factory->createClient('localhost?timeout=0.5');
```

#### createLazyClient()

The `createLazyClient(string $redisUri): Client` method can be used to
create a new [`Client`](#client).

It helps with establishing a plain TCP/IP or secure TLS connection to Redis
and optionally authenticating (AUTH) and selecting the right database (SELECT).

```php
$client = $factory->createLazyClient('redis://localhost:6379');

$client->incr('hello');
$client->end();
```

This method immediately returns a "virtual" connection implementing the
[`Client`](#client) that can be used to interface with your Redis database.
Internally, it lazily creates the underlying database connection only on
demand once the first request is invoked on this instance and will queue
all outstanding requests until the underlying connection is ready.
Additionally, it will only keep this underlying connection in an "idle" state
for 60s by default and will automatically close the underlying connection when
it is no longer needed.

From a consumer side this means that you can start sending commands to the
database right away while the underlying connection may still be
outstanding. Because creating this underlying connection may take some
time, it will enqueue all oustanding commands and will ensure that all
commands will be executed in correct order once the connection is ready.
In other words, this "virtual" connection behaves just like a "real"
connection as described in the `Client` interface and frees you from having
to deal with its async resolution.

If the underlying database connection fails, it will reject all
outstanding commands and will return to the initial "idle" state. This
means that you can keep sending additional commands at a later time which
will again try to open a new underlying connection. Note that this may
require special care if you're using transactions (`MULTI`/`EXEC`) that are kept
open for longer than the idle period.

While using PubSub channels (see `SUBSCRIBE` and `PSUBSCRIBE` commands), this client
will never reach an "idle" state and will keep pending forever (or until the
underlying database connection is lost). Additionally, if the underlying
database connection drops, it will automatically send the appropriate `unsubscribe`
and `punsubscribe` events for all currently active channel and pattern subscriptions.
This allows you to react to these events and restore your subscriptions by
creating a new underlying connection repeating the above commands again.

Note that creating the underlying connection will be deferred until the
first request is invoked. Accordingly, any eventual connection issues
will be detected once this instance is first used. You can use the
`end()` method to ensure that the "virtual" connection will be soft-closed
and no further commands can be enqueued. Similarly, calling `end()` on
this instance when not currently connected will succeed immediately and
will not have to wait for an actual underlying connection.

Depending on your particular use case, you may prefer this method or the
underlying `createClient()` which resolves with a promise. For many
simple use cases it may be easier to create a lazy connection.

The `$redisUri` can be given in the
[standard](https://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes/prov/redis) form
`[redis[s]://][:auth@]host[:port][/db]`.
You can omit the URI scheme and port if you're connecting to the default port 6379:

```php
// both are equivalent due to defaults being applied
$factory->createLazyClient('localhost');
$factory->createLazyClient('redis://localhost:6379');
```

Redis supports password-based authentication (`AUTH` command). Note that Redis'
authentication mechanism does not employ a username, so you can pass the
password `h@llo` URL-encoded (percent-encoded) as part of the URI like this:

```php
// all forms are equivalent
$factory->createLazyClient('redis://:h%40llo@localhost');
$factory->createLazyClient('redis://ignored:h%40llo@localhost');
$factory->createLazyClient('redis://localhost?password=h%40llo');
```

You can optionally include a path that will be used to select (SELECT command) the right database:

```php
// both forms are equivalent
$factory->createLazyClient('redis://localhost/2');
$factory->createLazyClient('redis://localhost?db=2');
```

You can use the [standard](https://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes/prov/rediss)
`rediss://` URI scheme if you're using a secure TLS proxy in front of Redis:

```php
$factory->createLazyClient('rediss://redis.example.com:6340');
```

You can use the `redis+unix://` URI scheme if your Redis instance is listening
on a Unix domain socket (UDS) path:

```php
$factory->createLazyClient('redis+unix:///tmp/redis.sock');

// the URI MAY contain `password` and `db` query parameters as seen above
$factory->createLazyClient('redis+unix:///tmp/redis.sock?password=secret&db=2');

// the URI MAY contain authentication details as userinfo as seen above
// should be used with care, also note that database can not be passed as path
$factory->createLazyClient('redis+unix://:secret@/tmp/redis.sock');
```

This method respects PHP's `default_socket_timeout` setting (default 60s)
as a timeout for establishing the underlying connection and waiting for
successful authentication. You can explicitly pass a custom timeout value
in seconds (or use a negative number to not apply a timeout) like this:

```php
$factory->createLazyClient('localhost?timeout=0.5');
```

By default, this method will keep "idle" connection open for 60s and will
then end the underlying connection. The next request after an "idle"
connection ended will automatically create a new underlying connection.
This ensure you always get a "fresh" connection and as such should not be
confused with a "keepalive" or "heartbeat" mechanism, as this will not
actively try to probe the connection. You can explicitly pass a custom
idle timeout value in seconds (or use a negative number to not apply a
timeout) like this:

```php
$factory->createLazyClient('localhost?idle=0.1');
```

### Client

The `Client` is responsible for exchanging messages with Redis
and keeps track of pending commands.

Besides defining a few methods, this interface also implements the
`EventEmitterInterface` which allows you to react to certain events as documented below.

#### Commands

All [Redis commands](https://redis.io/commands) are automatically available as public methods like this:

```php
$client->get($key);
$client->set($key, $value);
$client->exists($key);
$client->expire($key, $seconds);
$client->mget($key1, $key2, $key3);

$client->multi();
$client->exec();

$client->publish($channel, $payload);
$client->subscribe($channel);

$client->ping();
$client->select($database);

// many more…
```

Listing all available commands is out of scope here, please refer to the [Redis command reference](https://redis.io/commands).
All [Redis commands](https://redis.io/commands) are automatically available as public methods via the magic `__call()` method.

Each of these commands supports async operation and either *resolves* with
its *results* or *rejects* with an `Exception`.
Please see the following section about [promises](#promises) for more details.

#### Promises

Sending commands is async (non-blocking), so you can actually send multiple commands in parallel.
Redis will respond to each command request with a response message, pending commands will be pipelined automatically.

Sending commands uses a [Promise](https://github.com/reactphp/promise)-based interface that makes it easy to react to when a command is *fulfilled*
(i.e. either successfully resolved or rejected with an error):

```php
$client->set('hello', 'world');
$client->get('hello')->then(function ($response) {
    // response received for GET command
    echo 'hello ' . $response;
});
```

#### PubSub

This library is commonly used to efficiently transport messages using Redis'
[Pub/Sub](https://redis.io/topics/pubsub) (Publish/Subscribe) channels. For
instance, this can be used to distribute single messages to a larger number
of subscribers (think horizontal scaling for chat-like applications) or as an
efficient message transport in distributed systems (microservice architecture).

The [`PUBLISH` command](https://redis.io/commands/publish) can be used to
send a message to all clients currently subscribed to a given channel:

```php
$channel = 'user';
$message = json_encode(array('id' => 10));
$client->publish($channel, $message);
```

The [`SUBSCRIBE` command](https://redis.io/commands/subscribe) can be used to
subscribe to a channel and then receive incoming PubSub `message` events:

```php
$channel = 'user';
$client->subscribe($channel);

$client->on('message', function ($channel, $payload) {
    // pubsub message received on given $channel
    var_dump($channel, json_decode($payload));
});
```

Likewise, you can use the same client connection to subscribe to multiple
channels by simply executing this command multiple times:

```php
$client->subscribe('user.register');
$client->subscribe('user.join');
$client->subscribe('user.leave');
```

Similarly, the [`PSUBSCRIBE` command](https://redis.io/commands/psubscribe) can
be used to subscribe to all channels matching a given pattern and then receive
all incoming PubSub messages with the `pmessage` event:


```php
$pattern = 'user.*';
$client->psubscribe($pattern);

$client->on('pmessage', function ($pattern, $channel, $payload) {
    // pubsub message received matching given $pattern
    var_dump($channel, json_decode($payload));
});
```

Once you're in a subscribed state, Redis no longer allows executing any other
commands on the same client connection. This is commonly worked around by simply
creating a second client connection and dedicating one client connection solely
for PubSub subscriptions and the other for all other commands.

The [`UNSUBSCRIBE` command](https://redis.io/commands/unsubscribe) and
[`PUNSUBSCRIBE` command](https://redis.io/commands/punsubscribe) can be used to
unsubscribe from active subscriptions if you're no longer interested in
receiving any further events for the given channel and pattern subscriptions
respectively:

```php
$client->subscribe('user');

$loop->addTimer(60.0, function () use ($client) {
    $client->unsubscribe('user');
});
```

Likewise, once you've unsubscribed the last channel and pattern, the client
connection is no longer in a subscribed state and you can issue any other
command over this client connection again.

Each of the above methods follows normal request-response semantics and return
a [`Promise`](#promises) to await successful subscriptions. Note that while
Redis allows a variable number of arguments for each of these commands, this
library is currently limited to single arguments for each of these methods in
order to match exactly one response to each command request. As an alternative,
the methods can simply be invoked multiple times with one argument each.

Additionally, can listen for the following PubSub events to get notifications
about subscribed/unsubscribed channels and patterns:

```php
$client->on('subscribe', function ($channel, $total) {
    // subscribed to given $channel
});
$client->on('psubscribe', function ($pattern, $total) {
    // subscribed to matching given $pattern
});
$client->on('unsubscribe', function ($channel, $total) {
    // unsubscribed from given $channel
});
$client->on('punsubscribe', function ($pattern, $total) {
    // unsubscribed from matching given $pattern
});
```

When using the [`createLazyClient()`](#createlazyclient) method, the `unsubscribe`
and `punsubscribe` events will be invoked automatically when the underlying
connection is lost. This gives you control over re-subscribing to the channels
and patterns as appropriate.

#### close()

The `close():void` method can be used to
force-close the Redis connection and reject all pending commands.

#### end()

The `end():void` method can be used to
soft-close the Redis connection once all pending commands are completed.

#### error event

The `error` event will be emitted once a fatal error occurs, such as
when the client connection is lost or is invalid.
The event receives a single `Exception` argument for the error instance.

```php
$client->on('error', function (Exception $e) {
    echo 'Error: ' . $e->getMessage() . PHP_EOL;
});
```

This event will only be triggered for fatal errors and will be followed
by closing the client connection. It is not to be confused with "soft"
errors caused by invalid commands.

#### close event

The `close` event will be emitted once the client connection closes (terminates).

```php
$client->on('close', function () {
    echo 'Connection closed' . PHP_EOL;
});
```

See also the [`close()`](#close) method.
